Boulder Colorado Scanner Frequency list.  freqs.txt

This data is intended for the listening public.  It is provided free of
charge.  Feel free to pass it on to others.  Please leave this header
intact so folks will know where you found this and will know where to
look next time.

Use of this information in the commission of a crime is prohibited and
prosecutable by Local, State & Federal Laws.  Transmitting on
frequencies where you don't hold a license is a crime.  Don't program
transmitters unless you are licensed for the frequencies.

Public Safety frequencies are constantly changing.  Send updates to me
and I'll update the list for the benefit of your future use and the
benefit of others.

I primarily listen in Boulder.  This list only attempts to cover
Boulder.  If you want other areas in Colorado, I recommend:
	<http://www.radioreference.com/apps/db/?stid=8>

When a channel is repeated, I provide the input (xmit) frequency.  There
have been occasions when I'm close by and can hear the unit transmitting
when the repeater can't.  Not often, but occasionally.  I don't provide
PL (CTCSS) information.  Casual/hobby listeners don't generally need
this information: those that want it, have access to it.

Formatting: I choose to use fixed width, tabbed text.  This was more
elegant with wideband frequency plans because there were only three
digits to the right of the decimal.  Now that some have 4 digits, it
slides my tab stop to the right which doesn't allow for good
readability and also reduces the space available for comments.  My
workaround: truncate narrowband frequencies.  So, if a frequency ends
in a 2 or 7, it really has a 5 as the "ten-thousandths" digit
	Example: 159.247 is really 159.2475

05-Dec-2014: updated AMR Boulder info
26-Feb-2012: updated VTAC, UTAC, 8TAC info
12-Jan-2012: added BMFPD info.  Thanks David Kabal!
